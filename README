Steel - Command line password manager

Password management belongs to the command line. Deep into the Unix heartland,
the shell. With Steel your passwords are safe. Steel uses RIJNDAEL encryption in CFB
mode with 256 bit keys. Steel is simple, Steel is advanced, Steel is adaptable.
Steel is the new prophet of password management.

Steel uses libsteel library (https://gitlab.com/Rosvall/libsteel)

Steel is developed and tested on GNU/Linux but it probably runs on other Unix
like operating systems too.
