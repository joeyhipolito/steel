At the moment there's no binary packages available for Steel, so you will need 
to compile Steel from the source code. It's easy and fast.

Steel has two parts. Libsteel which is the shared library and implements
all the necessary functionality for Steel to work.

Libsteel depends on SQLite, Mhash and Libmcrypt. Of course also GCC and GNU Make
are required.

To install the dependencies on Mint 17.3 or Ubuntu 14.04:

      sudo apt-get install libmhash-dev libmcrypt-dev libsqlite3-dev
    
To install the dependencies on Archlinux:

      sudo pacman -S libmcrypt mhash sqlite

To compile libsteel, move to the source code directory and type

      make
      sudo make install

libsteel will be installed on /usr/local/lib/. 

To install Steel command line client move to Steel source code directory
and type following commands:

      make
      sudo make install
    
Steel will be installed on /usr/local/bin/ by default. Man page will be installed 
to /usr/local/share/man/man1/.
